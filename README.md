# SQL Portfolio

Welcome to my SQL Portfolio! This repository showcases my familiarity with:

- **Basic Queries** (SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY)
- **Intermediate Queries** (JOINS, subqueries, window functions)
- **Advanced Topics** (stored procedures, triggers, performance tuning, transactions)
- **Schema Design** (normalization, ER diagrams, table creation scripts)

## Repository Structure

- **basics/**: Introductory queries and exercises  
- **intermediate/**: More complex queries, window functions  
- **advanced/**: Stored procedures, triggers, optimization  
- **schema_design/**: ER diagrams and table creation scripts

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository or download the ZIP.
2. Load the sample data into your preferred SQL engine (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.).
3. Run the queries from each folder to explore different functionalities.

## Databases Used

- Examples are tested primarily on PostgreSQL and MySQL.
- Some queries may require small modifications to run on other SQL dialects (e.g., SQL Server, Oracle).
